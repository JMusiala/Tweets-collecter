A side project that was created to collect tweets from the accounts of selected users and deliver them in a simple, readable form.

This used Python data scraping libraries and a graphical representation in the form of a GUI from the library -PySimpleGUI.

The whole thing was an experimental project and is not further updated. Last update August 2022.
